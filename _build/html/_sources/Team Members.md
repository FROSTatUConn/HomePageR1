## President

![Team Member 1](Picture2.png)

- **Name:** Spencer Marci (He/Him)
- **Fun Fact:** I carry a Rubik's cube at all times.
- **Bio:** Hello. I helped co-found FROST in the ‘21. I went to my first NHRL event in July ‘21 with a few friends. Before the day was over, we were planning our first design. Since then I've helped build 5 or 6 different battle bots (I've lost track, honestly) and participated in a few more NHRL events. As the club president, I help manage the club and support newer builders with their own designs.
